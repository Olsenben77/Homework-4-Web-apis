# Homework-4-Web-apis

This fourth homework assignment gave us the challenge of creating a user-input based quiz, complete with a subtracting timer and high score local-storage page. The purpose of this website was to quiz users on JavaScript concepts, gaining them time-based points for each question scored correctly. It also tests our knowledge of writing several functions and adding properties to HTML elements. HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript were all used to fully complete this task. More focus is pressured on "heavier" JavaScript topics than our 3rd assignment, such as adding event listeners and appending classes.

## Motivation

I created this web-based quiz application to practice and increase my abilities in JavaScript coding, while still staying connected to HTML concepts. This was the most challenging task to date, but it has prepared me for bigger JavaScript opportunities.

## Features

Homework 4 runs the user through an online quiz experience, beginning at a Start-Up page that features a High-Scores linked page, a description of the quiz, and a functional Start Quiz button. Using mostly JavaScript concepts, the quiz generates sets of listed questions as the user attempts to select the correct answer. As the quiz progresses through the questions, a timer counts down time relative to the validity of the question answer. The clicking of the displayed buttons generates a list of questions until the array is completed. On the final page, users are able to record their high scores to a local browser storage. All-together, the application is a seamless run through of quiz questions powered by JavaScript functions.
